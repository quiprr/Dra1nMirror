### Current Version
1.3.2

  **The long awaited source reveal.** Sadly I do not have access to the backend code for *reasons* that I can't be bothered searching for. I don't have the original git data for the repo, however below is the line counts for the app and tweak part.
  ![Screenshot of line counts](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/778754358673932318/779898408495874058/image0.png)As you can see, the work seems fairly unbalanced. You'll notice that the .xm file has 2 versions, well that's because Mega's code was quite frankly awful to read. The left number is before auto format, the right number is after auto format. This source contains both versions. I used after format number for the total values.

Open sourcing dra1n was the original plan from both myself and Mega, he even said it himself here: ![Comment Screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/778754358673932318/778773426320048168/image0.png)
